* Introductions
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Introduce yourself
+ Introduce Dan
+ Talk about Kitware
+ Hiring,  interested in jobs,  interested in skills for jobs,  come talk to us

* Attribution
+ [[https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/][FSF Email Self-Defense]]
+ [[https://ssd.eff.org/en][EFF Surveillance Self-Defense]]

* Straw Poll
+ How many people use Windows/Mac/Linux?
+ How many people use a web browser as their primary means of accessing thier email?
+ How many people use Outlook,  Apple Mail,  Thunderbird? 
+ Is anyone already using encryption?

* What are we doing today?
+ *High-level* - why encryption, some basic encryption theory
+ *Mid-level* - vocabulary and general outline
+ *Low-level* - installing software, encrypting messages

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ High & Medium levels will be lecture/questions & answer
+ Low level will be following tutorials with help from me/dan
#+END_NOTES

* Why Encryption? 
*** You don't need encryption if you have nothing to hide
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Common argument against encryption

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Usually people mean
  + + "I believe no one is going to bother really looking into what i'm doing on the internet"
+ Probably right 
  + no actual person is going to look at your data
+ Live in an era of machine learning
  + algorithms will consume that data and make decisions about your digital life for you
  + If that bothers you,  you have the power to say stop that - but no one is going to stop it for you.

*** Ideally, only intended recpient can convert back to the message

* How do?
*** Traditional encryption
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ How does our recipient know how to decode the message, when nobody else can? 
+ It must be because they know some extra information that nobody else knows. 
+ Let's call this the "key", because it unlocks the message inside the code.

+ Where does this key come from?  
+ Usually prearraged,  'i.e. - try holding the mssage up in a mirror'
+ 'take each letter and convert it to the next letter in the alphabet'
#+END_NOTES

*** Problems with "traditional" encryption
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Unless you whisper in someones ear,  a spy might intercept the message that communicates the secret
+ Sharing secret keys in parking garages is cool - does not scale
+ Not internet ready - might want to communicate securely with someone i've never met
+ Particularly problematic if your algorithm/key is open source!
#+END_NOTES


*** Public/Private Key Encryption
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ public-key cryptography solves this problem really nicely 
+ Instead of a single piece of information ("key") there are two keys
+ One key is public,  one key is private
+ Anything encrypted with the public key can ONLY be decrypted with the private key
+ Reverse also true - get back to this when we talk about signing
#+END_NOTES

*** Give your public key to everyone
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Anyone can send you a coded message because everyone can get your public key
+ They can be garunteed (assuming your private key is secure) that ONLY you can decrypt the message.
+ What happens when you want to reply? 
+ You find THIER public key and encrypt your reply - garunteeing that only THEY can read the reply.
#+END_NOTES

*** Public Key Servers
+ [[https://pgp.mit.edu/][MIT PGP Public Key Server]]
+ [[https://keys.fedoraproject.org/][Fedora's OpenPGP Key server]]
+ [[https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/wiki/Home][SKS keyserver]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ SKS is a mesh network, submitting to one means all keyservers will get the public key
#+END_NOTES


** Flip side of Encryption - Signing
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Solves single key issue -  you encrypt with my public key, I encrypt with your public key
+ Private key can also encrypt,  and only be decrypted with public key 
+ Might not seem useful - why encrypt something that everyone can decrypt?
#+END_NOTES

*** Encrypt with your private key to garuntee you wrote the message
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ If I encrypt a message and send it out 
+ assuming I'm the only one who has my private key
+ Then you can be garunteed that no one screwed with the message 
+ and that I wrote it!
#+END_NOTES

** Never put your private key on a computer you don't control!
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ All of this relies on some assumptions 
+ NO ONE ELSE HAS YOUR PRIVATE KEY
+ Never upload it to another computer
+ Never email it or instant message it or
+ Never put it on dropbox,  or in any other publically available location!
#+END_NOTES


* Some practical encryption terms
*** Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Phil Zimmermann (1991) 
+ Actually a joke - Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery (Prarie home companion) - in reality it is VERY GOOD privacy
+ When Edward Snowden says "encryption works"  he is talking about PGP
+ PGP software eventually bought by Symantec
+ Eventually became open standard "OpenPGP"
#+END_NOTES
*** Pretty Hard to Understand
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Unfortunately somewhat archaic and hard to understand
+ Fortunately many programs that make OpenPGP easier to use
#+END_NOTES

*** Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ GPG is a common, open source implementation of OpenPGP
+ Unfortunately named leads to sentences like (use "GPG" to do "PGP")
+ GPG is open source and there are Open source implementations for Mac, Windows & Linux
#+END_NOTES

*** Gnu Privacy Assistant (GPA)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Graphical interface to GPG
#+END_NOTES

*** GPG Keychain
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ You encrypt with other people's public key 
+ keeping track of those keys can be a pain
+ GPG Keychain is designed to manage other people's 
#+END_NOTES

* The Problem with Web Mail
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ The problem with web mail is 
#+END_NOTES
*** You are not in control
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Your browser is connecting to a remote server 
+ where all the actual work of moving, marking and sending mail is happening
+ Breaks rule No. 1 - never give your private key to ANYONE
#+END_NOTES
*** Not in Google's interest
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ In fact there are ways that this could work technically
+ Not really in google's self interest 
+ They want to read your mail and sell that information to advertisers
+ Encryption prevents them from doing that
#+END_NOTES

*** So I have to use a local email program?
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
+ For hassle free integration of encryption - yes
+ Can use an open source email client like Thunderbird
+ Advantage is sending a signed/encrypted email is as simple as sending a regular email
+ Even if you daon't want to do that,  you can still use encryption
#+END_NOTES

*** You can still use encryption!
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ You can still use encryption 
+ you just have to encrypt your email on your local computer
+ Copy and paste the encrypted message into the text box
+ Send your email
+ In fact this is all plugins to Thunderbird/Apple Mail etc are doing
#+END_NOTES


* Practical steps (Mid Level)
#+BEGIN_NOTES

#+END_NOTES
*** 1. Download GPG software for your Operating system
+ Mac OSX - [[https://gpgtools.org/][GPGTools]]
+ Windows - [[https://www.gpg4win.org/][GPG4Win]]
+ Linux - [[https://www.gnupg.org/download/][From the GPG website]]

*** 2. Create a public and a private key
+ Going to be asked for personal information 
+ Use you're *real* name and email address

*** 3. Upload your public key to a public key server
+ [[https://pgp.mit.edu/][MIT PGP Public Key Server]]
+ [[https://keys.fedoraproject.org/][Fedora's OpenPGP Key server]]

*** 4. Ask a neighbor for their public key
+ Look them up on the public key server
+ Email them your public key
+ Use a flashdrive

*** 5. Import their public key into your Keychain

*** 6. Encrypt a message with their public key

*** 7. Send them that message
+ When you recieve a message from your neighbor,  use your key to decrypt it.

*** 8. Congratulations!

* How are we going to do this (Low-Level)?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Too many machines,  too many environments and setups
+ Going to take questions on theory/background 
+ Then going to point you towards some tutorials
+ Dan and I will be here to help
