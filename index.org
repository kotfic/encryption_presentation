* Why Encryption? 
** You don't need encryption if you have nothing to hide

* Some encryption theory
** What is encryption?
*** Convert a plain text message to a coded message

*** Ideally, only intended recpient can convert back to the message

** How do?
*** Traditional encryption
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ How does our recipient know how to decode the message, when nobody else can? 
+ It must be because they know some extra information that nobody else knows. 
+ Let's call this the decoding key, because it unlocks the message inside the code.

+ Where does this key come from?  
+ Usually prearraged,  'i.e. - try holding the mssage up in a mirror'
+ 'take each letter and convert it to the next letter in the alphabet'
#+END_NOTES

*** Problems with "traditional" encryption
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Unless you whisper in someones ear,  a spy might intercept the message that communicates the secret
+ Sharing secret keys in parking garages is cool - does not scale
+ Not internet ready - might want to communicate securely with someone i've never met
#+END_NOTES


** Public/Private Key Encryption
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ public-key cryptography solves this problem really nicely 
#+END_NOTES

*** Never put your private key on a computer you don't control!
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Never upload it to another computer
+ Never email it or instant message it or
+ Never put it on dropbox,  or in any other publically available location!
#+END_NOTES


*** Public Key Servers
+ [[https://pgp.mit.edu/][MIT PGP Public Key Server]]
+ [[https://keys.fedoraproject.org/][Fedora's OpenPGP Key server]]
+ [[https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/wiki/Home][SKS keyserver]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ SKS is a mesh network, submitting to one means all keyservers will get the public key
#+END_NOTES

** Flip side of Encryption - Signing

* Some practical encryption terms
** Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Phil Zimmermann (1991) 
+ Actually a joke - Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery (Prarie home companion) - in reality it is VERY GOOD privacy
+ When Edward Snowden says "encryption works"  he is talking about PGP
+ PGP software eventually bought by Symantec
+ Eventually became open standard "OpenPGP"
#+END_NOTES
*** Pretty Hard to Understand
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Unfortunately somewhat archaic and hard to understand
+ Fortunately many programs that make OpenPGP easier to use
#+END_NOTES

*** Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ GPG is a common implementation of PGP
+ Unfortunately named leads to sentences like ("GPG" implements "OpenPGP")
+ Using GPG to encrypt emails is what we'll be focusing on today.
#+END_NOTES

*** GPG Keychain

* The Problem with Web Mail
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ The problem with web mail is 
#+END_NOTES
*** Not in Google's interest
*** You can still use encryption!

* How are we going to do this?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ Too many machines,  too many environments and setups
+ Going to take questions on theory/background 
+ Then going to point you towards some tutorials
+ Dan and I will be here to help
